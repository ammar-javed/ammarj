            This was definitely one of the most ambitious projects the global hacker community was anxiously waiting to come to fruition. 48 hours of coding, 1 GBPS internet connection, new cultural experiences and a new location every time.
            Unfortunately the event got cancelled in the month of the hackathon, but not before we got some major planning done!
            <br>
            <br>Some of my responsibilities were:
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• In charge of registration logistics for day of sign-in for 2000 hackers
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Managed volunteer/resource allocation for the hackathon duration
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Scheduled volunteers to make sure all events were covered with sufficient help starting from set up, execution and tear down

            Where do I even begin to describe this experience...
            <br>
            <br>I was brought into the team of a handful of individuals working on UofT's very own hackathon and I am so proud of all the work we accomplished, the brand we created around this hackathon, and most importantly,
            how many amazing projects we saw come out of a weekend of young minds and energy drinks.
            <br>
            <br>As the event grew, we also saw many highschool students attend this university level event and compete head to head with students years their senior, and even take home a few prizes!
            <br>
            <br>The two years in which I helped organize the event, I had the oppertunity to work on almost every aspect of this event;
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Contacting companies and confirmed sponsors for the event. Approximately $50,000 was raised from sponsors contacted by me, such as Shopify, Github, Google, IBM, Loblaws eCommerce, Redbull, etc.
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• I was also helping organize meals for the 36 hours hackathon. That included arranging the meals with caterers and restaurants, organizing volunteers for set up, handing out and clean up of food. I was also maintaining the snacks and drink supplies for the weekend.

            Astronomy has always been a fun hobby of mine! Space and our cosmos interests me greatly, so I thought I'd make the most of my university career by getting inolved a club which relates to my hobby.
            As the president of the ASX club, I managed a core executive team in charge of outreach, public relations and events. I oversaw the planning and preparation of an annual Symposium, highlighting certain topics relations to Astrophysics. 
            <br>
            <br>That involved contacting speakers from NASA, MIT, and other leading institutions in the area of Astrophysics to fly them out to our symposium. We also had a great sponsorship team 
            who made sure we had enough funds to hold the symposium in a large hall at the university.
            <br>
            <br>My other duties involved helping manage club finances, public relations with students, alumni, businesses, professors, scientists and professional institutions.
            <br><br>That year we also introduced new monthly 'Star Talk' lecture series for the students and general public which involved a lecture by a professor from around the GTA (Greater Toronto Area), and if the weather permitted, star gazing using UofT's large telescopes!

            My first ever professional CS related job! I worked on an android application called <u>LaunchTicker</u> which is available on the Google Play store. I contributed to:
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• in-app performance enhancements
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• gesture features (swiping to open news story in Web Activity, pull to refresh, etc.)
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• UI changes
            <br>
            <br>
            The remaining three months were spent on a <u>Windows 8</u> [Tablet] application for a major bank. The kiosk application was to be put in stores to provide insurance and banking information, as well as allow customers to apply for new credit cards straight instore.
            Since this was a full develompent cycle I was invovled in, I gained a lot of Product Management experience along with technical skills!
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Learned the Model-View-ViewModel  (MVVM) framework for Windows 8 tablet applications
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Worked 1 on 1 with the clients to outline product backlog and prioritize items to fit within the timeframe paid for
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Delivered weekly builds to QA and the clients for Test Driven Development and constant feedback
